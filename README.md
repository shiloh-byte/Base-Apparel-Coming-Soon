## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## My process
First I started with the HTML layout of the page, next I put together the mobile first CSS, and then added media queries for the desktop design.
After I felt I had a good basic design I worked on my JS by added eventListeners and DOM muniplulation. After that was complete I just made some
tweaks to the CSS to get it all finished.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I always learn something new every time I work with the DOM. I got to use classList.add and remove this time around and I haven't used them in a project yet.


### Continued development

I will continue to work with JavaScript as I am still learning new things everytime I dig into it. Also will continue to work with inputs. I 
had a difficult time figuring out how to get the positioning of the button to go over the input and to add the error icon into the input.
